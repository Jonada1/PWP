### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
1. The overview should be written in a way which can make a client want to buy the API. It has to be modified.
2. The description of Main concepts and relations has to be redefined and less functional, more descriptive.
3. User registration and test analysis is extra work and should be considered to implement if any time is left after the main project is completed.
4. API uses should consist only how the API will be used. Not very technical but descriptive.
